write a function "getEmployee" that returns an employee object with the following attributes
	id
	name
	basic
	tax -> in percent

	calculateSalary() -> returns the salary after tax

the "getEmployee" function should accept the initial values for all the employee attributes and initalize the employee object with the values before returning it.
